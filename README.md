FINTRACK PRO – CLI FINANCE MANAGER
Project Documentation

1. Introduction
FinTrack Pro is a command line based personal finance management system developed using Python, SQLite and SQLAlchemy ORM. 
The project helps users to manage daily expenses, track subscriptions, search records, maintain monthly budgets and generate analytics using raw SQL queries.

2. Objectives
• To understand ORM based database interaction  
• To use SQLite with Python  
• To implement CRUD operations  
• To write raw SQL for analytics  
• To design modular architecture  
• To build interview oriented project

3. Technologies Used
• Python  
• SQLite Database  
• SQLAlchemy ORM  
• Raw SQL Queries  
• CLI Interface

4. System Features
• Add Expense  
• Update Expense  
• Delete Expense  
• Search by Date  
• Category Analytics  
• Monthly Budget Alert  
• Persistent Storage

5. Database Design

Tables:
1. categories(id, name)  
2. expenses(id, title, amount, date, category_id)  
3. subscriptions(id, name, amount, next_date)  
4. budgets(id, month, limit)

Relationships:
Category 1 ---- N Expenses
